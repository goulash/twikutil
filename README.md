Package twikutil provides several functions to make working with the
(Twik)[https://github.com/go-twik/twik] language easier.

It also contains a subpackage key, which helps set variables prior to the
execution of a twik script, as well as read them afterwards.

The implementation is not yet well documented, and also not quite finished. :-)
For more information, see the [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/goulash/twikutil)! :-)
